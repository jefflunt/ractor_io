# this class loads the contents of a file using a Ractor so that it's running
# outside your main Ractor.
#
# Usage:
#   rio = RactorIO.new.read('/tmp/a_large_file.txt')  # read a file
#   ... do other stuff ...
#
#   # optional loop until the file is read
#   loop do
#     break if rio.ready?
#     sleep 1
#   end
#
#   rio.string    # contains the contents of the file as one large String
